        <div id="reflection-container">
            <div id="reflection-title">Reflection</div>
            <div id="reflection-paragraph">Throughout my time exploring elements of professional development in the
                student affairs field via the guided readings and assignments, I have been able to commit time to
                reflecting upon my own ideas around professional development and where I am in my HESA career.</div>
            <div id="reflection-paragraph">First of all, the experience of taking this Reflective Practice class as an
                entirely online, asynchronous course dedicated to professional development in the student affairs
                profession was a tremendous one in developing my skills as a scholar and practicioner. As a HESA
                scholar-practitioner, there are going to be times in which I will need to take initiatives on a project
                that made lead to a substantial amount of solo-work. I feel like the structure of this course has
                allowed me to further develop my skills in time management and given me additional confidence to dive
                into research and projects with limited supervision. Learning to trust myself to learn what I need to
                learn and accomplish what I need to accomplish was a valuable outcome of the way this course was
                structured.</div>
            <div id="reflection-paragraph">Another outcome of this Reflective Practice course is how much I have come to
                appreciate and value the personal and professional growth and well-being of HESA staff members. From my
                practice as a student affairs professional to my exploration of theory and research, I have come to
                understand in a new way how essential it is for the success of a campus to lay a foundation of support
                and care for faculty members. Knowing what I know now, I am better equipped to advocate for policies and
                initiatives that benefit staff members, as well as to take the issue into my own hands and create events
                and programs through my role to support fellow staff members.</div>
            <div id="reflection-paragraph">The most prominent challenge that I faced whilst completing this Reflective
                Practice course was not having access to a structured environment with other students to have
                discussions over course readings or general professional development topics. In other courses I have
                really benefited from getting the chance to hear from my fellow students in the Higher Education program
                and to have a structured way of discussing topics related to the class with one another and the faculty
                member. Despite this challenge, I was able to utilize this solo-exploration opportunity to develop my
                time management skills and build the confidence to explore different topics independently, which I think
                will only serve to help me going forward in my HESA career, especially as I take on larger projects and
                conference presentations.</div>
            <div id="reflection-paragraph">In conclusion, I have truly valued this opportunity to dive deeper into and
                reflect upon issues surrounding professional development in the HESA field. Going forward, I plan on
                using the information I have gathered to inform my practice in several ways, including serving on the
                Student Affairs Professional Development Committee, providing supportive programing for HESA
                professionals at my institution, and advocating for larger level policy changes that not only benefit me
                as a staff member, but staff members institution wide.</div>
