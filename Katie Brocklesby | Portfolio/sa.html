            <div id="sa-title">Student Affairs Philosophy</div>
            <div class="sa-paragraph">In Fall of 2022, I had the enlightening opportunity to participate in an exercise
                to reflect on my personal higher education/student affairs philosophy. Having been in the master’s in
                Higher Education program for over a year now as well as transitioning from a part-time graduate
                assistant to full-time staff, I would like to take this time to update my personal philosophy as it may
                have evolved with my experiences.</div>
            <div class="sa-paragraph">As my career has developed over the last year, thanks in part to work I have
                completed in courses such as this one, my philosophy on higher education has grown with it. The most
                marked change in my philosophy is the increased emphasis on the wellbeing of staff and faculty as
                cornerstone of the successful administration of an institution of higher education. Experiences that I
                have had over the last year as a full-time student affairs professional combined with research I have
                done in the course of my master’s program have brought to light just how important it is for university
                staff and faculty to feel supported by their administration in achieving job satisfaction and the
                professional goals they set out for themselves.</div>
            <div class="sa-paragraph">First, part of my philosophy of higher education is the large amount of
                responsibility I place on upper-level administrators to support and implement intuitional level policies
                that aid in job satisfaction for all staff. Sell (2023) emphasizes the importance of the implementation
                of organizational policies to increasing job satisfaction among student affairs professionals. My
                philosophy of student affairs aligns with this way of thinking and will work to advocate for such
                policies in my student affairs practice. Practically these policies can look like flexible work
                schedules and environments, ample opportunities for professional development, and mechanisms to provide
                feedback to administrators.</div>
            <div class="sa-paragraph">Second, through my experience this past year as a student affairs professional and
                student of higher education, I have truly come to value transparent communication as a means of
                supporting student affairs staff. Solomon & Tierney (1977) discuss the importance of transparency in how
                the reward structure matches the communicated institutional values. It is essential in my view for
                administrators to accurately communicate the reward structure of their division or institution and how
                that aligns with the values of the institution itself. For instance, an institution should ensure that
                they are prioritizing internal promotion opportunities if they communicate that they value developing
                their staff and increasing staff retention.</div>
            <div class="sa-paragraph">Finally, as another component of my updated student affairs philosophy, I’d like
                to talk a bit about how student affairs professionals perceive their fit for the role and the
                institution they work in. As I previously talked about transparent communication, in my view this
                practice should start before an applicant even submits their resume and cover letter. Organizations
                should make their expectations and values clear on any public materials or application portal so that
                any potential candidates are fully aware of how they might fit into the organizational structure and
                culture. Likewise, candidates should be extremely diligent in their research of universities they are
                interested in being a part of. If job satisfaction is an ultimate goal of the employer-employee
                relationship, then transparent communication when finding the right fit is essential (Issah, 2021).
            </div>
            <div class="sa-paragraph">
                Ultimately, my student affairs philosophy has changed in that I value even more the role that staff and
                faculty play in ensuring a healthy and successful campus environment for students. Students are always
                the focus of everything we student affairs professionals do, but we have to set a good foundation for
                our staff and faculty to work from. We cannot support our students and meet one hundred percent of their
                needs if staff to have the backing of administrative policies that promote well-being and transparent
                communication, particularly communication which allows for both employees and employers to find the best
                fit with each other.
